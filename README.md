    Software generates a Galois field GF(2^k).  Galois fields are finite fields, mathematical objects which contain a set of elements (numbers) and operations addition, subtraction, multiplication, division and, and, by extension of the multiplication operation, exponentiation and kth roots (k is limited).  The fields are closed under these operations.  

There exists one element, "zero", which is the additive identity element (x + zero = x).  Every field element has an additive inverse, or "negative" such that 
    x + -x = 0.  
In GF(2^k) fields, every element is its own additive inverse: 
    x + x = 0.  
However, this does not mean that 2 * x is zero. 

    There also exists an element, "one", which is the mltiplicative identity element.  For any element x in the field, 
    x * 1 = 1 * x = 1.  
Every nonzero element in the field has a unique multiplicative inverse in the field such that 
    x * inv(x) = inv(x) * x = 1.  
Unlike the usual rational or real number fields, which are infinite fields, the multiplicative inverse is representable as an integer.
